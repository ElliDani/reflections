When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on a project with other people, having a remote repository allows you all to have a central accessibly location to view your work or if you are working on the project from different computers. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In case there are changes that you've made to the repository that you don't want to share yet.
