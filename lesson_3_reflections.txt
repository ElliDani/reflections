When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on a project with other people, having a remote repository allows you all to have a central accessibly location to view your work or if you are working on the project from different computers. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In case there are changes that you've made to the repository that you don't want to share yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork allows you to make a copy of a GitHub repository and make changes without making changes to the original repository. Clone makes a copy of a repository to your local machine, changes made in the clone will not show up on the original. Branches will allow you to create a separate area on the original repository were others can view the branch. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You are able to work on the repository while offline.
